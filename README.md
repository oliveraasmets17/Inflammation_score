# Inflammation score

This repo includes codes to calculate microbiome inflammation index and evaluate its performance for disease classification. Microbiome inflammation index is based on predicting glycoprotein acetylation (GlycA) from the microbiome taxonomic data using LASSO regression. GlycA is an inflammatory marker that can characterize systemic low-grade inflammation. The microbiome inflammation score is defined as the weighted sum of the CLR-abundances of microbial species and provides an estimation of inflammation in the gut microbiome that is independent of age, gender, and BMI.
